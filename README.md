# Derin's Dark Mode Extension

Now on the Chrome Web Store! [Extension link](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/derins-dark-mode-extensio/jpjefolfdeankiloknnhfglcpcpbiead)

To use:

- Click the "Derin's Dark Mode" extension icon while on a page, and toggle the checkbox
- You can also set a shortcut for toggling the page in chrome://extensions/shortcuts

Features:

- Whitelist-based system (you need to explicitly turn it on for each domain)
- The dark mode is just reverse contrast, ignoring images and iframes
- Occasionally transparent images might be hard to see, but this is an unsolvable problem
- Correctly handles full screen inversion unlike most extensions online
- Now has the choice to fully invert sites including images, if you want

The goal here is making something simple that works well.

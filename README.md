To install:

- Turn on dev mode in chrome://extensions
- Download the zip file from the GitHub releases and drag it into the chrome://extensions page
- Installed!

(These steps are necessary because the extension isn't on the web store right now. Maybe I will upload it eventually.)

To use:

- Click the "Derin's Dark Mode" extension icon while on a page, and toggle the checkbox
- You can also set a shortcut for toggling the page in chrome://extensions/shortcuts

Features:

- Whitelist-based system (you need to explicitly turn it on for each domain)
- The dark mode is just reverse contrast, ignoring images and iframes
- Occasionally transparent images might be hard to see, but this is an unsolvable problem
- Correctly handles full screen inversion unlike most extensions online

The goal here is making something simple that works well.
